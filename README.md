[Multiavatar](https://multiavatar.com) is a multicultural avatar generator.

In total, it is possible to generate **12,230,590,464** unique avatars.

Initially coded in JavaScript, this version of Multiavatar is re-created in PHP. It can be used in PHP-based backend environments.

For more details about the Multiavatar Generator, please refer to the readme available in the JS [repository](https://github.com/multiavatar/Multiavatar).


### Installation ###

If you don't use composer, just include `Multiavatar.php` in your application.

```
require_once('Multiavatar.php');
```

Via Composer:

```bash
composer require multiavatar/multiavatar-php
```


### Usage ###

```
$multiavatar = new Multiavatar();
$avatarId = "Binx Bond";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId);
```

For advanced usage, pass boolean `true` as the second parameter if you wish to generate an avatar without the environment part.

Pass an associative array as the third parameter to generate a specific avatar version.

```
$multiavatar = new Multiavatar();
$avatarId = "ANY_STRING";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId, true, ["part" => "11", "theme" => "C"]);
```

See `index.php` for examples.


### API ###

This PHP script is powering the [Multiavatar API](https://api.multiavatar.com). Simply pass the avatar's ID as the URL parameter, and the API will return the avatar's SVG code.

```

```

Below is a JavaScript API call example:

```
let avatarId = 'Binx Bond'
